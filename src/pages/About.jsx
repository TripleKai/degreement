        <h1>How it works</h1>
        <h2>
          Offer contract and financing proposal are created by the buyer on
          Degreement
        </h2>
        <h2>
          Degreement creates a Smart Contract that encapsulates contingencies
          and terms
        </h2>
        <h2>
          The document access is shared by buyer and seller, who can conduct
          negotiations through it in real-time to clearly see updates, counters,
          rejections, and acceptances of terms
        </h2>
        <h2>
          Once buyer and seller accept terms and conditions, seller note is
          created and title search is conducted to generate a report in short
          order
        </h2>
        <h2>
          Buyer finds the best title insurance provider based on the generated
          report to then purchase from (Degreement recommends partnered
          providers to simplify their search)
        </h2>
        <h2>
          Before closing, buyer sends any down-payment (+ any negotiated fees)
          to the Smart Contract. Seller sends the deed (+ other documentation
          and seller credits) to the Smart Contract
        </h2>
        <h2>
          Closing can now be conducted by remote notary on an agreed-upon time,
          where buyer and seller sign digital signatures to satisfy the Smart
          Contractâ€™s conditions, which releases the held funds to the seller,
          the deed (+ other documents and seller credits) to the buyer, and
          commissions to the agents.{' '}
        </h2>
        <h2>
          Degreement sends recording request to the local Register of Deeds
          office to officially record the transaction.
        </h2>
